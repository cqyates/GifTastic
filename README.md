This an an application that uses ajax calls with Giphy to make a pre-teen friendly GifFinder for my 14 year old niece.  The searches are limited to gifs with a rating of G.  It is preloaded with three birthday themed buttons for searching and the ability to create new buttons from the search .

The gifs have data attributes with allows them to load in their still state and play when clicked.
