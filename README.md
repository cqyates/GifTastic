This an application that uses ajax calls with Giphy to make a pre-teen friendly GifFinder for my 14 year old niece.  The searches are limited to gifs with a rating of G.  It is preloaded with birthday themed buttons for searching and the ability to create new buttons from the search input field.

The gifs have data attributes with allows them to load in their still state and play when clicked.
